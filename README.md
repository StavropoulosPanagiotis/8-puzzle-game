This is my implementation of the widely known 8-puzzle-game where the user picks the initial state of the board (both were the empty cell will be and initial values of all the other cells).
The final state is this:

1 - 2 - 3

4 - 5 - 6 

7 - 8 - 

The cells can move up, down, right, left, but also diagonally.
When the user clicks a button it automatically moves itself to the available position, but if he clicks a button that has no available moves nothing happens and he must click another one
